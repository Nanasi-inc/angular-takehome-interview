## Objective

Your goal is to build a web app that integrates with [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/#api-endpoints-v3-all) to pull country data and display it like in the designs

##### Expected Functionality

- List all countries from the API
- Filter countries by region

##### Additional Expectations

- The application should be deployed somewhere (Netlify, Vercel, GH Pages) that we can access it. You should provide a link to the working app as part of your submission via email.
- You should provide a link to the publicly available repository whenever you send the submission email. We will also evaluate the provided codebase as part of your submission.
- This assignment should be completed **no more than 72 hours after receiving it**.

##### Bonus Points

- Add ability to search country by name using Angular's Reactive Forms Module
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page

#### Technologies We Expect You To Incorporate

- Use [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) (already installed) to build an almost pixel-perfect app to the designs. Refer to design files under `./mockups` folder.
- It should be responsive
- Use [RxJs](https://rxjs.dev/guide/overview) to achieve reactivity
- [Angular Reactive Forms](https://angular.io/guide/reactive-forms)

## Setup Instructions

1. Fork this repo as a starting template. We have included all necessary packages required to complete this assessment.
2. Install the packages by running
   ```
   $ npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server
   ```
   $ npm start
   ```
4. Start hacking away!

## Submission

After you have pushed your code, you should submit the assignment by replying to the email you've received with:

- The link to the deployed and working application.
- The link to your own repository's main branch on Github.
